## 1. Architecture & Folder Structure

In this project every section of the page is divided into components and stored in components folder. Styles are also divided into individual CSS file for each component. This helps us to add styling easily without having any conflicts of classes.

This structure is chosen in order to keep the code clean and easy to maintain. In this structure each component is responsible for a particular section of the page, which makes any update and finding error simpler. This also helps in preventing changes in one component from affecting the rest of the application.
